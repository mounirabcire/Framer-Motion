How to implement that:
1- first is to create parent div that have a 300 viewport hight
2- inside the parent div, create a sticky div with top of 0px,
3- since the parent div has a 300 viewport hight, so the sticky div will stick at top of 0px of 300vh
4- we have to set the parent div as a target of our scroll event (my mistake is that I set the target to sticky div, so I run with some errors)
